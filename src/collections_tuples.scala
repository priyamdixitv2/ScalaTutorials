/*The actual type of a tuple depends upon the number and of elements it contains and the types of those elements. Thus, the type of (99, "Luftballons") is Tuple2[Int, String]. The type of ('u', 'r', "the", 1, 4, "me") is Tuple6[Char, Char, String, Int, Int, String]

Tuples are of type Tuple1, Tuple2, Tuple3 and so on. There currently is an upper limit of 22 in the Scala if you need more, then you can use a collection, not a tuple. For each TupleN type, where 1 <= N <= 22, Scala defines a number of element-access methods. Given the following definition âˆ’
